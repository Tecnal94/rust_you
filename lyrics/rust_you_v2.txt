Buddy you are new 
Haven’t got one clue
‘Bout the trouble that your code is gonna make you suffer through

You copy and you paste, you make your data race
You dangle your pointers all over the place

You hear 
“We will we will rust you”



Buddy you’re a veteran
You’re a little better and
You wanna make things greater than 
the CRUD stuff you’re tethered at

You wanna be the best, but techno debt’s
A chain on your neck that keeps holding you back

You hear
“We will we will rust you”



Buddy you’re now older
35 the magic number
And your heart has gotten colder
“Do I still like this?” You wonder.

Coding life is now a daily strife
This one thing called time cuts you like a steely knife

But you say 
“We will we will rust you”

Buddy you are new 
兄弟你是萌新
Haven’t got one clue
暂时啥也不懂
‘Bout the trouble that your code is gonna make you suffer through
想不到自己的代码能给自己带来多大麻烦

You copy and you paste, you make your data race
你一路Ctrl + C/V 大法，数据疯狂竞争
You dangle your pointers all over the place
你的指针撒欢如脱缰的野马

You hear 
这时你听到
“We will we will rust you”


Buddy you’re a veteran
兄弟你是老兵了
You’re a little better and
稍微懂了一点
You wanna make things greater than 
你想做点有趣的事情
the CRUD stuff you’re tethered at
不想每天无限CRUD

You wanna be the best, but techno debt’s
你想做到最好，但是太多技术债
A chain on your neck that keeps holding you back
像锁链一样绑住你的手脚

You hear
这时你听到
“We will we will rust you”


Buddy you’re now older
兄弟你年纪大了
35 the magic number
到了传说中的35岁
And your heart has gotten colder
你的热血一天天冷却
“Do I still like this?” You wonder
怀疑自己还爱不爱干这个

Coding life is now a daily strife
敲代码变成了一场自我斗争
This one thing called time cuts you like a steely knife
岁月像把钢刀一样刺痛着你

But you say 
但是你说
“We will we will rust you”
我要让你这把刀生锈！
